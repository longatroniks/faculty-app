# RIT Information Sciences & Technologies Faculty App Website

## Project Modernization: .NET 6 to .NET 8

This project is currently undergoing modernization from .NET 6 to .NET 8. The application is a web interface for Rochester Institute of Technology's Information Sciences & Technologies department, providing information about degrees, faculty, and employment opportunities.

## Project Overview

The website connects to RIT's API endpoints to fetch and display information about:
- About the department
- Undergraduate and graduate degree programs
- Co-op and professional employment opportunities
- Faculty profiles and contact information

## Tech Stack

### Original (.NET 6)
- ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6)
- Bootstrap for styling
- jQuery for frontend interactions
- Newtonsoft.Json for JSON deserialization

### Modernization Target (.NET 8)
- ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)
- Bootstrap (latest version)
- Modern JavaScript approaches
- System.Text.Json (preferred in .NET 8)
- Improved async patterns

## Key Improvements in Migration

The migration to .NET 8 offers several advantages:

1. **Performance Improvements**: .NET 8 includes significant performance enhancements over .NET 6.
2. **Modern HTTP Client Factory**: Using the recommended HttpClientFactory pattern instead of direct HttpClient instantiation.
3. **Native JSON Handling**: Moving from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json for better performance.
4. **Improved Dependency Injection**: Leveraging enhanced DI capabilities in .NET 8.
5. **AOT Compilation Support**: Ability to use Ahead-of-Time compilation for better startup performance.
6. **Minimal API Support**: Opportunity to reduce boilerplate code.
7. **Enhanced Security**: Latest security patches and improvements.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains the HomeController which handles routing for the main sections
- **Models**: Data models that represent the structure of API responses
- **Views**: Razor views for displaying data from the controllers
- **wwwroot**: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)

## API Endpoints

The application connects to the following API endpoints from RIT:
- `http://ist.rit.edu/api/about` - Information about the department
- `http://ist.rit.edu/api/degrees` - Degree program information
- `http://ist.rit.edu/api/employment` - Employment statistics and opportunities
- `http://ist.rit.edu/api/people/faculty` - Faculty information

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have .NET 8 SDK installed
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or your preferred IDE
4. Build and run the application
